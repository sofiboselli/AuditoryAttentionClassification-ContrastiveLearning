# AuditoryAttentionClassification-ContrastiveLearning

This is the code for the final thesis titled "Auditory Attention Classification with Contrastive Learning" by SofÃ­a Boselli and Gautam Sridhar of the master degree in Machine Learning, Systems and Control at LTH, Lund University. 

## ABSTRACT

> Auditory attention detection is crucial for understanding speech in noisy environments, a challenge known as the "cocktail party problem." This project investigates the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to identify which speaker a listener attends to. EEG's portability and real-time recording capabilities make it a promising tool for practical applications.

> We propose a novel neural network model for auditory attention detection using EEG data. The model reconstructs the attended speech envelope while simultaneously classifying attended vs. unattended speech. It incorporates a contrastive learning loss function (SigLIP), which, to our knowledge, has not been previously applied to EEG-based auditory attention detection. The model architecture combines convolutional, fully connected, and attention layers.

> Evaluated on an EEG dataset with 31 subjects, the model achieves a mean accuracy of 68\% and a mean correlation of 0.105 between the reconstructed and attended envelopes. This surpasses the baseline performance of linear methods (63\% accuracy, 0.084 correlation). These results suggest the potential of contrastive learning for improving auditory attention detection accuracy, warranting further investigation.

## About The Code

The provided code allows to make a hyperparameter search with the function `getSearchFunction` or to run only one case with the function `train_one_case`. An example of the last one is:

```
config = {
    "overlap": 0.7,
    "lr": 6e-4,
    "batch_size": 128,
    "temp": 10,
    "embedding": 8, 
    "rec_embedding": 32,
    "weight_decay": 0,
    "env_dropout": 0.4, 
    "eeg_dropout": 0.2, 
    "kernels": [30,20,40],
    "bias": 10,
}

enc, test_loader = train_one_case(config, None, False)
torch.save(enc, '/mimer/NOBACKUP/groups/naiss2023-22-692/Sofia-Gautam/HyperParameterSearch/final_python_model.pth')
```
